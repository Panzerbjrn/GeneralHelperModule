Function Get-RebootHistory {
    <#
		.SYNOPSIS
			Retrieves historical information about shutdown/restart events from one or more remote computers.

		.DESCRIPTION
			The Get-RebootHistory function uses Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to retrieve information about all shutdown events from a remote computer.

			Using this function, you can analyze shutdown events across a large number of computers to determine how frequently shutdown/restarts are occurring, whether unexpected shutdowns are occurring and quickly identify the source of the last clean shutdown/restart.

			Data returned includes date/time information for all available boot history events (e.g. restarts, shutdowns, unexpected shutdowns, etc.), date/time information for unexpected reboots and detailed information about the last clean shutdown including date/time, type, initiating user, initiating process and reason.

			Because Get-RebootHistory uses WMI to obtain shutdown event history from the system event log, it is fully supported against both legacy and current versions of Windows including legacy versions that do not support filtering of event logs through standard methods.

		.PARAMETER ComputerName
			Accepts a single computer name or an array of computer names separated by commas (e.g. "prod-web01","prod-web02").

			This is an optional parameter, the default value is the local computer ($Env:ComputerName).

		.PARAMETER Credential
			Accepts a standard credential object.

			This is an optional parameter and is only necessary when the running user does not have access to the remote computer(s).

		.EXAMPLE
			.\Get-RebootHistory -ComputerName prod-web01,prod-web02 -Credential (Get-Credential)

			Get boot history for multiple remote computers with alternate credentials.

		.EXAMPLE
			.\Get-RebootHistory -ComputerName prod-web01,prod-web02 -Credential (Get-Credential) | ? { $_.PercentDirty -ge 30 }

			Get a list of computers experiencing a high percentage of unexpected shutdown events.

		.EXAMPLE
			.\Get-RebootHistory -ComputerName prod-web01,prod-web02 -Credential (Get-Credential) | ? { $_.RecentShutdowns -ge 3 }

			Return information about servers that have been experiencing frequent shutdown/reboot events over the last 30 days.

		.OUTPUTS
			System.Management.Automation.PSCustomObject

			Return object includes the following properties:

				Computer
				BootHistory				: Array of System.DateTime objects for all recorded instances of the system booting (clean or otherwise).
				RecentShutdowns			: The number of shutdown/restart events in the last 30 days.
				UnexpectedShutdowns		: Array of System.DateTime objects for all recorded unexpected shutdown events.
				RecentUnexpected		: The number of unexpected shutdown events in the last 30 days.
				PercentDirty			: The percentage of shutdown events that were unexpected (UnexpectedShutdowns/BootHistory).
				LastShutdown			: System.DateTime object of the last clean shutdown event.
				LastShutdownType		: Type of the last clean shutdown event (Restart | Shutdown).
				LastShutdownUser		: The user who initiated the last clean shutdown event.
				LastShutdownProcess		: The process that initiated the last clean shutdown event.
				LastShutdownReason		: If available, the reason code and comments for the last clean shutdown event.
